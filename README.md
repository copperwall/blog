# The OpperBlog

This is my personal blog, which I've put together using

* HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
* MySQL
* PHP
* Python
* JavaScript/AJAX

The page will initially load the lastest two posts from the database, and then will add two more each time the user asks for more.

Post input is dealt with by a Python script that takes plain text files and inserts them correctly into the database

## Improvements
* Currently uses mysqli\_connect, could switch to PDO
* Info pane could use some refreshing
